## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. LibraryView
   - **Description**: Allows avid readers to find books in a similar fashion to a traditional library: searching for books by shelves sectioned by category. In a more built-out app, LibraryView could allow users to look through a 3d view of shelves and 'move' around the library. 
   - **Category:** Entertainment
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for this because this allows users to have a digital library at their finger tips. Also the act of looking for books is a very casual task that can be done remotely and on-the-go.
   - **Story:** Creates a digital environment that is reminiscent of the traditional library experience.
   - **Market:** Anyone who is interested in books, especially traditional libraries. 
   - **Habit:** After finishing one book, users can look back to the app to find their next read.
   - **Scope:** V1 would allow users to look at a simple view of a library and search for books by category. V2 would allow users to get a digital copy of the books from this app. V3 would incorporate a movable view of the library for an immersive experience.
